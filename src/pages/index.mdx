# Adam Vosburgh's Digital Portfolio

### Hello, and thank you for reviewing my application. 

My name is Adam, and I'm deeply committed to issues around the built environment. I believe architects should diversify their tools and knowledge sets to make our knowledge more valuable to more audiences. This website is an outgrowth of that belief, a site built as a portfolio viewer - without the usual problems inherit to pdf submissions.

I am finishing my M. ARCH at the Columbia GSAPP in May 2022, am actively searching for roles that fit me. If you'd like to talk, feel free to email at adamvosburgh(at)gmail.com.

Below you can find links to my resume and my portfolio, among other things.
